# Heterogeneous-Effects-of-Monetary-Policy-on-Expenditure
This research aims to explore the microeconomic impacts of information shocks
originating from monetary policy announcements on consumer spending across different income
strata. Despite a rich body of literature on the macroeconomic effects of monetary policy, less
attention has been paid to how these policies influence individual consumer behaviors, particularly
in response to the non-policy information revealed during policy announcements. Utilizing a
Structural Vector Autoregression (SVAR) model, this study will isolate the effects of information
shocks from standard monetary policy actions to analyze their impact on consumer expenditure
patterns.
